 Sliding Window
 --------------
 The sliding window algorithm can be used to solve problems that involve linear sequences, such as arrays. A window is a contiguous sequence which is part of an array.
 As the name suggests, the window is slid over the array and it gives us the minimum/maximum/sum of every contiguous sequence of the array in O(n) time
